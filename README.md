# Introduction to Git and Github

This is a brief introduction to git and github. Conceptual overview slides are available as well as a quick reference guide and a more comprehensive command list.  

Below are examples of the more common commands you're likely to used regularly. These are also rendered as a brief blog post [here](https://eshinjolly.com/2019/01/04/git_github/).
